Dashboard needs to have Analytics filterable and searchable by Campaign from a dropdown list. Campaigns opens up a field to filter and search by token in a campaign. The selected token displays full analytics for the token and campaign including: transaction tracking and history for users and provide real-time updates on token balances, transaction status, and conversion rates.
